# Part 1 - Bootstrap UI Layout
<!-- built a navigation bar using the nvbar component -->
<!-- built a two-column layout using the row, container and col-md features -->
<!-- added a styled button with the btn btn-primary feature -->
-used a native javaScript alert() triggered by the button
### Experience:
Using bootstrap was very straightforward and easyto get started with.
The components are very well-structured and easy to intergrate. However we found the design options somewhat limited -customization is not as flexible.

## Tailwind CSS
-used utility classes like grid 
-styled each card using utilities such as 'rounded', 'shadow'
-included a call to action button
### Experience
 Tailwind css was more complex at first because it uses a utility first approac.
 however it gave us much more flexibility and variety in terms of layout and design. Overall, Tailwind gave us more creative freedom compared to Bootsrap, but it had a steeper learning curve.

 ## React.js
 -React.js via Codesandbox template
 -Used a funcional component with props to display a custom welcome message
 - added a button that toggles a message using the useState hook

 ### Experience 
 React.js was a powerfull tool for building interactive UI. The ability to manage state and props made it easier to structure components in a reusable way. The declarative approach was very different from vanilla JavaScript, and it took a bit of adjustment, but once understood, it felt more logical and scalable for building dynamic pages.
